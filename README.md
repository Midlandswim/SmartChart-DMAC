# SmartChart & DMAC Research
SmartChart Patient Charting App and the Deployable Medical Assistance Case

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani & Giacomo Pugliese <br />
Advisors: Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) & Mr. Joseph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Oliver Dobrich (BCA) <br />
Context: Future Health Professionals (HOSA) International Leadership Conference Medical Innovation <br />
Projekt Name: SmartChart & Deployable Medical Assistance Case <br />
Start Date: April 04, 2023 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research competition and its related fields of engineering and medicine. This was also made for recording my process of solving the issue at hand so that others can learn and build upon my work. An award-winning software that is the most intelligent and efficient virtual patient charting application for emergency medical technicians on the market, SmartChart utilizes an algorithm that suggests treatment based on patient information. A machine learning model provides diagnostics and appropriate protocols, and more. SmartChart supports audio transcription and translation for patient charting and communication, as well as OCR for written notes. The DMAC was made for our entry into the Medical Innovations Category at HOSA ILC. The team previously won 1st place at the HOSA New Jersey State Conference for Medical Innovation, allowing us to qualify for HOSA ILC in Dallas, TX, in 2023. I was not officially a member of the team during this time, only joining after their accomplishment at the New Jersey State Conference due to scheduling conflicts keeping me from joining the team in an official capacity prior to ILC Qualification. This is why I acted as an unofficial engineering consultant for the project. We finished as semifinalists at HOSA ILC 2023, placing in the top 40 teams in the World. This was done in a team consisting of Giacomo Pugliese, Andrea Kim, and myself. I was the engineer in the group and personally designed the entire DMAC environment, including the aesthetics, custom enclosures, device programming, and solar power systems. The goal of this project is to work in concert with SmartChart, using AI to process and collect data to diagnose and treat patients. Used by EMTs, the DMAC and SmartChart will help revolutionize emergency patient care. This project has no end date as an innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
