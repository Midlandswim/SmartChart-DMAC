# DMAC Research
Deployable Medical Assistance Case

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani <br />
Advisor: Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) & Mr. Joseph Barbetta (BCA) <br />
Context: Future Health Professionals (HOSA) International Leadership Conference Medical Innovation <br />
Projekt Name: Deployable Medical Assistance Case (Solar Powered) <br />
Start Date: April 04, 2023 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research competition and its related fields of engineering and medicine. This was also made for recording my process in solving the issue at hand so that others can learn and build upon my work. The DMAC was made for our entry in the Medical Innovation Category at HOSA ILC. We previously won 1st place at the HOSA New Jersey State Conference for Medical Innovation allowing us to qualify for HOSA ILC at Dallas, TX in 2023. This was done in a team along with Giacomo Pugliese and Andrea Kim. I was the engineering in teh group, and personally designed the entire DMAC Enviroment, including the aesthtics, custom enclosure, and solar power systems. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
