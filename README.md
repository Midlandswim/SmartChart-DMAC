# DMAC Research
Deployable Medical Assistance Case

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani & Giacomo Pugliese & Andrea Kim <br />
Advisors: Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) & Mr. Joseph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Oliver Dobrich (BCA) <br />
Context: Future Health Professionals (HOSA) International Leadership Conference Medical Innovation <br />
Projekt Name: Deployable Medical Assistance Case (Solar Powered) <br />
Start Date: April 04, 2023 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research competition and its related fields of engineering and medicine. This was also made for recording my process in solving the issue at hand so that others can learn and build upon my work. The DMAC was made for our entry in the Medical Innovation Category at HOSA ILC. We previously won 1st place at the HOSA New Jersey State Conference for Medical Innovation allowing us to qualify for HOSA ILC at Dallas, TX in 2023. This was done in a team, conssisting of Giacomo Pugliese, Andrea Kim, and myself. I was the engineer in the group, and personally designed the entire DMAC enviroment, including the aesthtics, custom enclosures, and solar power systems. The goal for this project is to work in concert with SmartChart, using AI to process and collect data to diagnose and treat patenits. Used by EMTs, the DMAC and SmartChart will help revolutionize emergency patient care. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
